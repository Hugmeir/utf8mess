=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.17.10

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.17.9 release and the 5.17.10
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.17.8, first read
L<perl5179delta>, which describes differences between 5.17.8 and 5.17.9.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

There are no longer any differences in the parsing of identifiers specified
as $... or ${...}; previously, they were dealt with in different parts of
the core, and so had slightly different behavior. For instance,
C<${foo:bar}> was a legal variable name.  Since they are now both parsed
by the same code, that is no longer the case.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.  In
particular, deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed as
an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

[ List each deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

L<Benchmark> has been upgraded from version 1.14 to 1.15.

This reverts (for now) a change in 1.14 whereby the "too few iterations"
message became a warning on STDERR instead of being output on STDOUT. It's
now on STDOUT again.

large changes to the testing harness (e.g. when parallel testing was added).
Changes to existing files in F<t/> aren't worth summarizing, although the bugs

=item *

The new copy-on-write mechanism that was introduced in 5.17.7 has now been
disabled by default, since it was felt that there were too many rough
edges for the 5.18 release. It is expected that it will be enabled by
default for 5.20.

This change also re-enables PL_sawampersand by default.

It can be enabled in a perl build by running F<Configure> with
B<-Accflags=-DPERL_NEW_COPY_ON_WRITE>, and we would encourage XS authors to
try their code with such an enabled perl, and provide feedback.
XXX need blurb, e.g. a reference to a new section in perlguts or perlxs
explaining how XS authors should handle COW strings.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

files in F<ext/> and F<lib/> are best summarized in L</Modules and Pragmata>.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
